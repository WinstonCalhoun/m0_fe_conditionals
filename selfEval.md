1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
// Same as the comparison operators.  Very close to math problems.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
// Very confident in understanding if statements.

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
//  A little too long, but once past the wall it was easy and smooth....maybe an hour after the wall.

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
//  I need to continue to play around with the variables and see if i can create my own just to see the output.

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
//  No questions off the top of my head but if I need too, my fellow students and instructors are extremely helpful.  The internet is also a great place as long as the information lines up with what the instructors want us to be learning.
